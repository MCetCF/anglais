# INTRODUCTION

## Introducing the concept of code talking with the idea of translation to send
secretly a message

        To send secretly a message, we know we can use:
	- steganography, hiding the message;
	- cryptography, transforming the message into an apparent nonsense with
	  the possibility to recover the message for selected persons
	But there can be imagined another technique, such as:
	- translation of the message into an obscure language
	This isn't a crypto system because there isn't generally only one way to 
	translate a message and some content aren't translatable.
	
	
	This method have been used during the 20th century by people, called code talkers, who transmit by radio
	secret messages during wartime. 
	
	This method was particularly used by America which recruit native
	American who used their native language. 
	

## Why did they appears in the 20th century?
	- système crypto lent/transport sur le terrain difficile voir impossible.
		-> Example of the SIGABA.
	- invention of the radio
	- (donc, c'était vraiment LE moment où les code talkers étaient
	  possibles: on avait la radio mais pas encore de machine de cryptage
	  rapides..)

## Goal of code talker?
	Transmit as soon as possible messages, it is crucial that messages be
	encoded because of enemies.  

	Dire que l'on s'intéresse aux Navajos code talker mais qu'il faut d'abord expliquer les antécédents.


# History

## World war 1 :

### First use
	The first use of native American code talker : Cherokee. During Second Battle of the Somme in September 1918. 
	Unit 30th Infantry Division were under British command.

### Creation of code talker
  	During WW1, Germans tapped into telephone lines of American, break their codes, and captured runners send out to deliver messages directly. So, they have some tactical plans of enemies in their hands.

		Blocked situation in 1918. An idea pop because Captain Lawrence
		of US Army eared two Choctaw (Solomon Louis and Mitchell Bobb)
		talking together in their own language the Choctaw => creation
		code talkers. Find 8 Choctaw in battalion and 14 in 36th
		Infantry Division. They used them to build a code with 20 terms
		and transmit secret tactical messages in their native language.
		They helped to win during the Meuse-Argonne Offensive. In 24
		hours, they turned the tide of the battle. And in 72, Germans
		are going back.


## End World War 1 : Germans wants to understand and get prepared ?
	Germans and Japanese studied some Indians languages. German send 30 anthropologists to learn native American languages

	But, they didn't learn a lot of languages because of the diversity:
	They were too much to learn.

## World war 2 :
	Réflexion sur de nouveaux code talker : Navajos

	US Army reflect on the use of code talker in World war 2 but they were afraid that the code would be easily break.

	
	They discovered that the Navajo is a complexe language which is hard to understand, only talk in the reservation, complexe grammar, unwritten language. Navajo localisation Southwest of America.

	In 1942, on a propose of Phillip Johnston, they decided to try a code based on Navajo languages
	-> RACONTER LE TEST QUI A ETE EFFECTUE ET PARLER DE LA LETTRE ECRITE
	PAR GENERAL 
	
		-  Major General Clayton Barney Vogel:
		"
		On February 28, 1942, General Vogel tested the idea of the Navajo code
		talkers by "installing a telephone connection between two offices and wrote out
		six messages that were typical of those sent during combat. One of those
		messages read "Enemy expected to make tank and dive bomber attack at dawn." The
		Navajo managed to transmit the message almost verbatim: "Enemy tank dive bomber
		expected to attack this morning." The remaining messages were translated with
		similar proficiency, which duly impressed General Vogel. "
 
 LA lettre fournit une transition cool car y'a dedans des arguments pour dire
 pourquoi le navajo c'est cool. Ce qui fait une bonne transition avec...
	
### Why the Navajo language was a good choice?
- The largest population of Native American so the possibility to recruit and
  from enough code-talkers;
- It remained mostly "unwritten".
- Except the Navajos, only a handful of american experts were able to speak 
  langage. Notably, german didn't know it even if they send some people
  to learn native american language before the begin of the WW2. -> less than
  30 non-navajo people could understand it according to the letter of major
  general Clayton.
- Navajo has a complex grammar, different from german and japanese 
- faster than any machine at this time.

# Navajo Code talkers

## History of Navajos

Ici, on peut parler de l'acculturation, si tu veux. Où ils vivent ...
-> j'hésite en fait, car ça me semble compliqué!
peut être juste une petit parenthèse? Un truc genre
"N'oublions pas au passage que les relations entre américains et américains
natifs furent très compliquées peut de temps avant. Par ex pour les navajo y'a 
la longue marche..."

## Recruitment
	29 Navajos recruit in May 1942 task develop a Navajo code
	Then, between 375 to 420 Navajos participate to the program.
	-> on peut parler du fait qu'il y a eu  tout au long de la guerre
	des formations

## The code
Explication du code, comment il est construit mettre image et exemple

On peut mettre un extrait de la langue ici

### Special code words
- Mot du monde militaire
- Mots pour épeler les mots non existant dans le code (c a dire un mot pour
  dire "a", un pour dire "b", etc)

### Evolution of the code
- In the first version of the code, there was only one word for each 
  letter of the alphabet. A cryptographer thought that 
  the code might be broken because of the risk of repetition 
  of some patterns when spelling out words not in the Navajo's
  vocabulary. As a result, more words has been added for the most
  frequency used letters in subsequent versions.
- "the original 211 vocabulary terms were also expanded to 411"

### Advantage and inconvenient of the code
	+ difficulté si on est pas natif de bien distinguer les sons
	+ difficulté de parler navaho, donc d'imposture, si on est pas natif
	+ Again faster than a machine they encode in just 20 seconds, and machine in 30 minutes.
	- si on a un navajo avec soi, c'est mort  -> PAS TOUT A FAIT VRAI: les
	  japonais ont enlevé un navajo mais il ne connaissait pas le code.. 
	- Kerckhoffs's principle NON respectés 
	- Non unicité des traductions pour message
	- Navajos trained at different times and place used sometimes 
	  différents words for specific military vocabulary, the solution
	  was to frequently "exchange" Navajos from one division into another.
	- There was not enough code talkers and some battalions remained without 
          the capacity to decrypt or encrypt messages.

	  A mettre quelque part:
	  The Navajo code is the only spoken military code never to have been deciphered

## Honors
### Declassification
They keep secret the program Navajo Code during years before declassified it in 1968. A partir de cette date des hommages ont été donnés régulièrement par différent biais. Film, documentaires, livres et récompense délivrées aux navajos.

## Situation actuelle

# CONCLUSION
Débat : Serait-il possible de refaire cette technique un jour? Mélangée avec des techniques modernes, est-ce que ça pourrait être déconcertant pour des ennemis?
-> un truc me gêne dans ce choix de débat mais je ne sais pas encore quoi!
