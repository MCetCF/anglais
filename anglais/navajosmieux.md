# INTRODUCTION

## Introducing the concept of code talking with the idea of translation

To send secretly a message, we know we can use:
- steganography, hiding the message;
- cryptography, transforming the message into an apparent nonsense with
  the possibility to recover the message for selected persons
  
But there can be imagined another technique, such as:
- translation of the message into an obscure language
This isn't a crypto system because there isn't generally only one way to 
translate a message and some content aren't translatable.


This method have been used during the first halt of the 20th century by people, called code talkers, who transmit by radio
secret messages during wartime. 

This method was particularly used by America which recruit native
American who used their native language. 
	

## Why by that time? 

The first half of the 20th century is the meeting of two conditions that we
think are necessary for the apparition of code talkers:
- The existence of the radio and the phone;
- The fact that most of the cipher machines were too slow and fragile 
- to be used for tactical field communications (as for example the SIGABA)..

## plan

We choose to speak of the Navajo code talkers who are the best know
and whose story is declassified since 1968.
We will first relate how Navajo  code talkers have been recruited; 
and then we will study the code they used.
PUIS VOIR QUOI? leur reconnaissance?  

# How Navajo code talkers have been recruited.

## Preliminary: the code talkers during the WWI

The first use of native American code talker : Cherokee. During Second Battle
of the Somme in September 1918.  Unit 30th Infantry Division were under British
command.

During WW1, Germans tapped into telephone lines of American, break their codes,
and captured runners send out to deliver messages directly. So, they have some
tactical plans of enemies in their hands.

	Blocked situation in 1918. An idea pop because Captain Lawrence
	of US Army eared two Choctaw (Solomon Louis and Mitchell Bobb)
	talking together in their own language the Choctaw => creation
	code talkers. Find 8 Choctaw in battalion and 14 in 36th
	Infantry Division. They used them to build a code with 20 terms
	and transmit secret tactical messages in their native language.
	They helped to win during the Meuse-Argonne Offensive. In 24
	hours, they turned the tide of the battle. And in 72, Germans
	are going back.


## Pacific War and the idea of Philip Johnston
	
December 7 1941: Attack on Pearl Harbor
Pacific war: 7 December 1941 – 2 September 1945		
 
Philip Johnston was a World War I veteran who had grown  up on the
Navajo reservation while his parents served there as missionaries. 
He was one of the few non Navajo people to master the Navajo language:
at 9 years old, he was  asker to  serve as an interpreter for a Navajo
delegation. 

In 1942, he proposed to the Marine Corps that Navajos and
other tribes could be recruit as code talkers.	

There was some concerns about this idea. Firstly, German send after the
first world war 30 anthropologists in America to learn native American
languages. Luckily, they didn't have the time to learn Navajo: there 
were too many languages to learn.

After some hesitations, the major general Clayton Barney Vogel 
accepted to give this idea a try.  
Johnston recruited four bilingual Navajos and, on February 28,
they go to Camp Elliott for a demonstration. 
Two 

Two of the Navajos had to translate in Navajo typical military field orders and to
to send it by radio to their companions who translated it in English.

For example, they translated 
"Enemy expected to make tank and dive bomber attack at dawn." 
into "Enemy tank dive bomber expected to attack this morning." They was
able to translate such message in approximatively 20 seconds, much
better than the 30 minutes needed by machines at that time.

The demonstration was a success and Major General Clayton wrote a
letter to the commandant of the Marine Corps recommending the Navajo

In May 1942, 29 Navajos recruit task develop a Navajo code.

#### transition
Let's see now some reason, some wrote  in the letter, that justifies   
the choice of Navajo and let's see how the Navajo code worked.
 
# Navajo and Navajo code..
## Why the Navajo language was a good choice?
- The largest population of Native American so the possibility to recruit and
  from enough code talkers;
- It remained mostly "unwritten".
- Except the Navajos, only a handful of American experts were able to speak 
  langage. Notably, German didn't know it even if they send some people
  to learn native American language before the begin of the WW2. -> less than
  30 non Navajo people could understand it according to the letter of major
  general Clayton.
- Navajo has a complex grammar, different from German and Japanese 
- faster than any machine at this time.


PUT HERE a sample of the Navajo language. 

## The code

### Special code words
Because of a lack of military terms in the Navajo language, there was the need
for a code which consist in two different parts:
- A dictionary for common military words; using for example fish's names for ships
- and bird's names for planes. (source for the picture
  https://www.cia.gov/news-information/featured-story-archive/2008-featured-story-archive/navajo-code-talkers/)
- A phonetic alphabet table, to spell word that aren't in the Navajo language
  nor the precedent dictionary;


### Advantage and inconvenient of the code
Advantages:
- It's difficult to to distinguish the sounds for uninitiated Navajo Speakers;
- Imposture aren't easy to make: it require to speak Navajo with a good accent.
- Again faster than a machine they encode in just 20 seconds, and machine in 30 minutes.
Inconvénients:
- non uniqueness of the translations on a message;
- Navajos trained at different times and place used sometimes 
  différents words for specific military vocabulary, the solution
  was to frequently "exchange" Navajos from one division into another.
- There was not enough code talkers and some battalions remained without 
  the capacity to decrypt or encrypt messages.

- Kerckhoffs's principles aren't observed: all the secret is in the code talkers.
  (Because of the code, to speak Navajo isn't sufficient).
	  

## Evolution of the code
- In the first version of the code, there was only one word for each 
  letter of the alphabet. A cryptographer thought that 
  the code might be broken because of the risk of repetition 
  of some patterns when spelling out words not in the Navajo's
  vocabulary. As a result, more words has been added for the most
  frequency used letters in subsequent versions.
- "the original 211 vocabulary terms were also expanded to 411"

## About the Navajos

Ici, on peut parler de l'acculturation, si tu veux. Où ils vivent ...
-> j'hésite en fait, car ça me semble compliqué!
peut être juste une petit parenthèse? Un truc genre
"N'oublions pas au passage que les relations entre américains et américains
natifs furent très compliquées peut de temps avant. Par ex pour les navajo y'a 
la longue marche..."

##  Recruitment, 
between 375 to 420 Navajos participate to the program. There  
	-> on peut parler du fait qu'il y a eu  tout au long de la guerre
	des formations
## Honors
### Declassification They keep secret the program Navajo Code during years
before declassified it in 1968. A partir de cette date des hommages ont été
donnés régulièrement par différent biais. Film, documentaires, livres et
récompense délivrées aux Navajos.

## Situation actuelle

# CONCLUSION
Débat : Serait-il possible de refaire cette technique un jour? Mélangée avec des techniques modernes, est-ce que ça pourrait être déconcertant pour des ennemis?
-> un truc me gêne dans ce choix de débat mais je ne sais pas encore quoi!

A mettre quelque part:
The Navajo code is the only spoken military code never to have been deciphered
