    %This method have been used during the first halt of the 20th century by people, called code talkers, who transmit by radio secret messages during wartime. 
    %This method was particularly used by America which recruit native

    Meeting of two conditions:\par
    \begin{itemize}
	\item The existence of the radio and the phone 
	\item By that time, most of the cipher machines were too slow and fragile  
	to be used for tactical field communications

\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{The long walk}
    In 1864:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item  deportation of approximately 8000 Navajo people by the
	       government of the United States of America
	\item forced trek over 480km into the Bosque Redondo camp.
    \end{itemize}
     
    \pause
    They were not informed of: 
    \begin{itemize} 
	\item where they were going 
	\item why they were being relocated 
	\item how long it would take to get there. 
    \end{itemize}

    Johnston recruited four bilingual Navajos and % , on February 28,
    they went to Camp Elliott for a demonstration. 

    \begin{itemize}
    \item Two of the Navajos translated in Navajo typical military field orders
          and sent it by radio to their companions

% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Why the Navajo language was a good choice?}
    	\begin{itemize}
	\item<1-> The largest population of Native American so the possibility to recruit and
	  form enough code talkers

	\item<2-> It remained mostly "unwritten".
	\item<3-> Except the Navajos, only a handful of American experts were
		able to speak this language. 	
 	\item<4-> Navajo has a complex grammar, different from German and Japanese 
	\item<5-> faster than any machine at this time.
	\item<6-> Extremely difficult to distinguish for uninitiated Navajo Speakers
	\item<7-> Imposture aren't easy to make: it requires to speak Navajo with a good accent.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{How it works}
    Because of a lack of military terms in the Navajo language, there was the need
    for a code which consisted in two different parts:
    \begin{itemize}
	\item Dictionary for common military words    
    \end{itemize}

    \frametitle{How it works}
	      \begin{itemize}
              \item Navajo Code Talkers memorized 17 pages of code during their training.
	      \item It was easier because of their culture of oral
		      transmission.
	      \end{itemize}
	      
	      A code talker answered one of his officers who had asked
	      why Navajos were able to memorize the complex code so quickly: 
	      
	      \begin{quote}
	      For us, everything is memory, it is part of our heritage. We have no written language.
	      Our songs, our prayers, our stories, they are all handed down from grandfather
	      to father to children and we listen, we hear, we learn to remember
	      everything. It is part of our training.\par

	      Man and His Life, by Henry and Georgia Greenberg,1996)

\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Some flaws of the code}
	About the code itself:
    \begin{itemize}
	\item<1-> Kerckhoffs's principles aren't observed.
	\item<2-> Non uniqueness of the translations on a message.
    \end{itemize}
	In practice:
    \begin{itemize}
	\item<3-> Navajos trained at different times and places so they
		develop different evolutions of the code.
	The solution to this flaw 
	was to frequently exchange Navajos from one division into another.
	\item<4-> There was not enough code talkers and some battalions
		remained without the capacity to decrypt and encrypt messages.

\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Evolution of the code}
    \begin{itemize}
	\item The original dictionnary of 211 terms has been progressively 
	expanded to 411.

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Declassification and recognition of code talkers after the war}
The program has been classified until 1968.

 
Recognition of code talkers:
\begin{itemize}
	\item 2000: the US Congree passed legislation to honor the Navajo Code Talkers
	  and give them special gold and silver congressional medals.
	\item 2008: the Code talkers recognition act was signed into law by president
	  George W. Bush, which recognizes every other native american code talker who served
	  in the United States military during WWI or WWII 
\end{itemize}

\pause
But there is still some lack of respect...
    \begin{itemize}
      \item 2017: during a White House event intended to honor the Navajo 
	 code talkers, Trump used the nickname "Pocahontas" to deride Elizabeth 
	 Warren, a political opponent.
