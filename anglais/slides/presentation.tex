    Meeting of two conditions:\par
    \begin{itemize}
	\item The existence of the radio and the phone

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Why the Navajo language was a good choice?}
    	\begin{itemize}

	  % Firstly, as Eric said this method was
	\item<1-> faster than any machine at this time

	% In addition, because Navajo are ...
	\item<2-> The largest population of Native American
	  % officiers had the possibility to recruit enough
          % navahos code talkers. 

	  % Then, as Eric mentioned, Navaho language was obscure
          % because only a handful of non Navajo were able
          % to speak it. Moreover, it remained mostly unwritten
	  %  and thus was difficult to study
	\item<3-> Only a handful of non Navajo were
		able to speak this language
	\item<3-> It remained mostly "unwritten"
	% C'est nécessaire cet ajout? Je ne vois pas comment bien
	% l'intégrer au message du dessus sans faire un enorme message
        % only in some literature, religious 

	  % The code is also secure because of the Navaho grammar, 
	  %  considered as complex. Moreover, it 
	  % is different from the German and Japanese one.
          % (pas sûr à 100% pour le one mais il me semble que dire
	  %  seulement "from the German and Japanese" serait faux)
 	\item<4-> Complex grammar
          % It's ..
	\item<4-> Extremely difficult to distinguish the language
          % If you aren't used to hear it.
	\item<4-> Imposture aren't easy to make
          % And above all, it is difficult to pretend to be a Navaho 
	  % code talker because it requires a good accent.

\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{A lack of military terms}
    % The first Navajo code talkers have had to create 
    % a code because there was a lack of military terms.
    % The code is in two part and the first is a dictionnary for common
    % military words
    Because of a lack of military terms, a code was needed.
    \pause
    \begin{itemize}
	\item Dictionary for common military words

  \frametitle{Evolution of the code}
  % Unfortunately, they realised that the military dictionary was too small.
  % So, they added 200 terms to it.

  %  Moreover, thanks to the advice of a cryptanalyst
  %  they also expanded the phonetic alphabet in order to have multiple words
  %  corresponding to one letter. This obviously made the code stronger.
    \begin{itemize}
	\item The original dictionary of 211 terms has been progressively
	expanded to 411
	\item  Multiple words to spell one letter

  \frametitle{Some flaws of the code}
  % However, the code steal have some flaw. Indeed, Kerchhoff's principles ...
	About the code itself:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item<1-> Kerckhoffs's principles aren't observed
      % Indeed, the secret lives in the secrecy of the Navaho language and the
      % navaho code
      % So, if a code talker is talks to the enemy, the code is broken.
	\item<2-> Non uniqueness of the translations of a message
		% There is always different ways to translate a message, 
		% this is inherent to the translation.
    \end{itemize}
	In practice:
    \begin{itemize}
	\item<3-> On the field, different evolutions of the code appeared
		% Coordination problem

	\item<4-> Some battalions didn't have code talkers
		% and so remained without the capacity to decrypt and encrypt messages.

 Vietnam War : End of the use of Navajo code talkers 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The program is declassified (1968)
		\item A possible cause was that cipher machines had become more efficient
	\end{itemize}
	
Beginning of recognition of code talkers

  \begin{itemize}
  \item 1982: Certificate of Recognition
  \item 2000: they received medals from the US Congree
  \item 2008: signature of the Code talkers recognition

    % They live close to ancient uranium mines and it is the cause of severe
  % health problems.

	  \item Infrastructures problems
    % A lot of Roads are impassable and no government had paid to arrange this.

  \item There is still some lack of respect
    %2017: during a White House event intended to honor the Navajo
    %code talkers, Trump used the nickname "Pocahontas" to deride Elizabeth
    %Warren, a political opponent.
