    	\begin{itemize}
	  % In addition to what Eric already said, the  OBLIGATOIRE


	% In addition, because Navajo are ...
	\item<1-> The largest population of Native American
	  % officiers had the possibility to recruit enough
          % Navahos code talkers.  OBLIGATOIRE

	  % Then, as Eric mentioned, Navaho language was obscure
          % because only a handful of non Navajo were able
          % to speak it. Moreover, it remained mostly unwritten
	  % and thus was difficult to study
	\item<2-> It remained mostly "unwritten"

	  % The code is also secure because the Navaho grammar
	  %  is complex and different from the German and Japanese one.
 	\item<3-> Complex grammar
		
	\item<4-> Imposture aren't easy to make
          % And above all, it is difficult to pretend to be a Navaho 
	  % if you don't have a good accent. 
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{How it works}

    % We just saw that Navaho was a good choice but it couldn't be used
    % directly because of a lack of military terms. As a consequence, 
    % the code talkers have created a code. OBLIGATOIRE

    % It consists in two parts; the first one is a dictionnary for common
    % military words
    Because of a lack of military terms, a code was needed.
    \pause
    \begin{itemize}
	\item Dictionary for common military words

\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{How it works}
    % The second one is a phonetic alphabet used for words 
    % that are not in the dictionary or in the Navaho langage. 

    % To make it, the logical choice would be to associate each letter
    % with a Navaho word beginning with this letter. However, the Navaho
    % doesn't have the same alphabet so, as you can see, each letter is 
    % associated to an English word which is translated in Navaho        OBLGATOIRE

      % navaho code
